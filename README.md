# WordSearch
This application was made in lieu of the final exam.
An ACM programming contest question was given, which we had to solve and give it a GUI.
Input must be read from a given text file (ACM.txt in this case).  

## How it works
1. The '2' on line 1 - indicates the number of puzzles to be inputted.  
2. The '6' and '12' on line 2 - indicates the number of rows and columns of letters.  
3. The letters from lines 3-8 are the letters for the word search puzzle.  
4. The '5' on line 9 - indicates the number of words to be inputted.  
5. Lines 10-15 are the words to be inputted.  
6. Then we repeat from step 2 until the end.
